**WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS BEHIND CUSTOMER CHURN IN THE NETWORK SERVICES INDUSTRY**  

I answered this question using a dataset from one of the leading telecoms companies in Africa. I turned this into a Power Bi dashboard combining both Power Query and DAX to transform raw data into insights.  

My main focus was on   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) **Demographics**: Who is churning (age, gender, location).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)**Physcographics**: Why are they churning.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) What's the impact on business (revenue) and how can we rectify.  

**PROCESS**  
1)Data Cleaning & Preparation  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns and handled missing values  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Creating conditional columns for grouping customers  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Tools used: Excel, Power Query Editor   
2)Data Modelling  
      &nbsp;&nbsp; •	Built DAX measures for KPIs like:  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    o	Churn Rate   
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   o	Active Revenue, Churned Revenue, Customer Count by Segment  
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o	Total revenue, Active Revenue
