**WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS BEHIND CUSTOMER CHURN IN THE NETWORK SERVICES INDUSTRY**  

I answered this question using a dataset from one of the leading telecoms companies in Africa. I turned this into a Power Bi dashboard combining both Power Query and DAX to transform raw data into insights.  

My main focus was on   
i) **Demographics**: Who is churning (age, gender, location).  
ii)**Physcographics**: Why are they churning.  
iii) What's the impact on business (revenue) and how can we rectify.  

PROCESS  
1)Data preparation..
•	Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns and handled missing values  
•	Creating conditional columns for grouping customers  
•	Tools used: Excel, Power Query Editor   
2)Data Modelling  
Built DAX measures for KPIs like:

Key Insights  
**Gender-Based Churn Patterns**  
•	Insight: A higher proportion of female customers are churning compared to male customers.  
•	Possible Explanation: This may indicate that female customers are more sensitive to service quality, pricing, or competitor offerings. It’s worth exploring whether marketing, support, or product   features are aligned with their expectations.  
 **Age-Driven Churn Trends**  
•	Insight: Customers aged 40 and above show the highest churn rates.  
•	Possible Explanation: Older customers may be less tolerant of pricing changes or service disruptions. They might also be more likely to switch to competitors offering simpler plans or better customer service.   
**Top Churn Drivers** 
•	Insight: High call tariffs and better competitor offer are the leading reasons for churn hence the reason why mobile sim devices users have the highest rate of churn also.  
•	Possible Explanation: Customers are price-sensitive and actively comparing alternatives. This suggests a need for competitive pricing, loyalty incentives, or bundling strategies to retain value-conscious users.  
**Tenure-Related Churn**  
•	Insight: Customers who have been with the company for 4 years or more are churning at higher rates.  
•	Possible Explanation: Long-term customers may feel neglected or undervalued, especially if newer customers receive better deals. This points to a gap in retention efforts—consider loyalty rewards, personalized offers, or proactive engagement for this segment.
