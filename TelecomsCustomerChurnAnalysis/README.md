**WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS BEHIND CUSTOMER CHURN IN THE NETWORK SERVICES INDUSTRY**

I answered this question using a dataset from one of the leading telecoms companies in Africa. I turned this into a Power Bi dashboard combining both Power Query and DAX to transform raw data into insights.

My main focus was on 
i) **Demographics**: Who is churning (age, gender, location)
ii)**Physcographics**: Why are they churning
iii) What's the impact on business (revenue) and how can we rectify
